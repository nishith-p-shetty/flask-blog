#### Description:
Hello, My name is Nishith P Shetty & this is my CS50X final project.
This is a blogging site made with python, flask as backend.
This also uses bootstrap templates and css.
And also uses sqlite3 for database.
There is a admin pannel which uses sessions to authenticate admin,
where admin can add, delete, edit posts.
It also has a contact me page where visitors can fill their details.
The same information is added to database and notificaton sent to admin email and visitor mail address.
